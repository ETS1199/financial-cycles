# financial-cycles

Where do rich countries sit in their financial cycle right now — and is any of them
running hot enough to look like the run-up to a banking crisis?

This is a live-data replication of Chen & Svirydzenka (2021), *"Financial Cycles – Early
Warning Indicators of Banking Crises?"* (IMF WP/21/116), across 30 advanced markets.

## What it does

The paper found that two measures warn about banking crises better than anything else:
how far **equity prices** and **economic output** sit above their long-run trend. It
calibrated a "too hot" line for each against 40 years of real crises.

This repo pulls both series for 30 countries from public statistical APIs, measures the
gap from trend the same way the paper does, and scores each country 0, ½, or 1 by how
many lines it crosses.

It is **not a crisis forecast.** The thresholds were calibrated on *other* countries'
crises, so a flag means "this looks like conditions that have preceded trouble
elsewhere" — not "a crisis is coming here."

## Running it

```bash
python fetch_data.py --refresh    # pull every series into data/raw/ (quarterly)
python -m engine.run              # compute gaps and the index
python docs/build_overview.py     # regenerate the site's data file
```

`fetch_data.py --list` prints every configured series. FRED needs a free API key in
`.fred_api_key` or `$FRED_API_KEY` ([get one](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)).

# Calculations — AM Overheating Index for Canada

Precise, step-by-step definition of every quantity we compute. Method follows Chen &
Svirydzenka (2021), IMF WP/21/116, Advanced-Market (AM) track. For *why* the method is
set up this way, see [decisions/](decisions/); for data provenance, see `SOURCES.md`.

## Notation & inputs

| Symbol | Meaning | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `SP_q`   | nominal share-price index, quarter q (period average) | FRED `SPASTT01CAQ661N` |
| `cpi_m`  | CPI all-items, month m (2002=100)                     | StatCan vector `v41690973` |
| `CPI_q`  | quarterly CPI = mean of the 3 months in quarter q     | derived |
| `G_q`    | real GDP, quarter q (SA)                               | FRED `NGDPRSAXDCCAQ` |
| `CR_q`   | total credit to private non-fin sector, level (nominal)| FRED `CRDQCAAPABIS` |
| `PR_q`   | real residential property price index                 | FRED `QCAR628BIS` |

All series are quarterly (monthly CPI is aggregated as below). Everything is worked in
natural logs; gaps are reported in percent.

## Step 1 — quarterly alignment of CPI

```
CPI_q = mean( cpi_m : m in quarter q )          # average of the quarter's 3 months
```

Both `SP_q` and `CPI_q` are period averages, so they line up consistently.

## Step 2 — real (inflation-adjusted) series

```
E_q = SP_q / CPI_q                 # real equity price index
G_q = NGDPRSAXDCCAQ                 # already real, SA — used as-is
CR_real_q = CR_q / CPI_q           # real credit (dashboard only)
PR_q                               # already real — used as-is (dashboard only)
```

(The absolute scale of `E_q` is irrelevant — only its deviation from trend is used.)

## Step 3 — logs

```
e_q = ln(E_q)      g_q = ln(G_q)      cr_q = ln(CR_real_q)      pr_q = ln(PR_q)
```

## Step 4 — band-pass filter (Christiano–Fitzgerald)

Extract the cyclical component with the CF band-pass filter, `drift=True` (series are
trending / I(1)). Frequency band = the paper's **AM-sample** min/max cycle length
(Table 2), in quarters:

| Series | low (p_l) | high (p_h) |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Equity | 8         | 22         |
| GDP    | 3         | 51         |

(Dashboard series use their own AM bands from Table 2: credit 5–50, property 5–36.)

The paper derives these bands by dating turning points (Harding–Pagan) across its
advanced-market sample and taking the group mean cycle length ± 2 s.d. — a **single band
per series for the whole AM group**. Every country covered here is in that group, so the
band applies by construction and we take it from Table 2 unmodified; that is what keeps our
gaps comparable to the paper's calibrated thresholds. We do not re-derive it.

## Step 5 — two-sided vs one-sided (real-time) gaps

Let `cf(x, p_l, p_h)` return the cyclical component of series `x`.

```
# Two-sided (hindsight): whole sample at once
cycle2s = cf(e, 8, 22)

# One-sided (real-time): recursive replay from the earliest feasible window,
# keep the last point each step.
for t in range(t0, T):        # t0 = smallest window the CF filter accepts
    c = cf(e[0:t+1], 8, 22)
    cycle1s[t] = c[-1]
```

("one-sided" / "two-sided" are the paper's own terms — Chen & Svirydzenka §D.)

The one-sided series is the headline "where are we now" read; two-sided is the cleaner
hindsight view.

A one-sided value **never changes** once computed — it depends only on data up to its own
quarter. What differs is the *hindsight* read of the same quarter: Canada 2024Q3 read +1.1%
in real time but sits at −5.6% two-sided today. The two converge at the final observation.
Source-data revisions (agencies restating GDP/CPI) are a separate channel and do move
values. See [decisions/0004](decisions/0004-one-sided-values-never-move.md).

## Step 6 — gaps in percent

```
gap_equity_q = 100 * cycle_equity_q        # ~percent deviation from trend
gap_gdp_q    = 100 * cycle_gdp_q           # = output gap, ~percent
```

(Log-deviation × 100 ≈ percent for the magnitudes involved; exact form is
`100*(exp(cycle)-1)`, negligibly different here.)

## Step 7 — flags (per quarter)

Compare each quarter's **one-sided** gap to the fixed AM threshold (Table 5):

```
I_equity_q = 1 if gap_equity_q > 6.7 else 0
I_gdp_q    = 1 if gap_gdp_q    > 1.3 else 0
```

Thresholds are levels above trend ("too hot"), fixed constants calibrated once by the
paper. Flag is quarter-by-quarter (the threshold value itself came from averaging the 4
quarters before past crises).

## Step 8 — Overheating Index

```
OI_q = w1 * I_equity_q + w2 * I_gdp_q
w1 = 0.497   (equity, normalized)      w2 = 0.503   (GDP, normalized)
```

Possible values: `0` (neither hot), `0.497` (equity only), `0.503` (GDP only),
`1.0` (both). Raw weights are 0.6/0.6 (Table 5); normalized to sum to 1.

## Thresholds & weights (Table 5, AM)

| Indicator | Threshold (% dev. from trend) | Weight | Normalized weight |
|-----------|------------------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Equity    | 6.7                          | 0.6    | 49.7              |
| GDP       | 1.3                          | 0.6    | 50.3              |

Weight = 1 − Type I error (missed crises) − Type II error (false alarms).

## Output-gap cross-check (validation only)

Sanity-check the filtered **GDP gap** against Canada's official output gap. Source (settled
in Phase 3): the **Bank of Canada**'s quarterly estimates (Valet `INDINF_*`) — all three
published measures: Current MPR, Integrated Framework, Extended Multivariate Filter.

Our gap is a band-pass **cyclical deviation**; the BoC gap is a **deviation from potential**
— different constructions, so we expect strong co-movement, not equality. On the 1981–2026
overlap (181 quarters), our **two-sided** GDP gap correlates **0.87–0.92** with the BoC gaps
(highest with the filter-based EMVF, 0.92); the **one-sided** real-time gap is weaker at
**0.64–0.71**, consistent with the paper's point that real-time filtering has lower signal.
Amplitudes are comparable (sd ≈ 1.8–2.2). Validation only — off the OI path. Implemented in
`engine/crosscheck.py`.

## Engine design decisions (locked)

Settled before building Phase 2. See also the method decision above — the one-sided filter
has **no warm-up** (Step 5).

1. **Per-series sample window.** Filter each series over its **own maximal clean sample**
   (real equity is available from ~1956, real GDP from ~1961), not clipped to a common
   start. The CF trend/drift is estimated per series over its full history — this is what
   the paper does, and it keeps each gap reproducible. Thresholds stay valid because they
   were calibrated on the paper's samples, not on ours.

2. **Ragged edge (latest end).** Each component is computed to its own latest available
   quarter. The composite `OI_q` is published **only for quarters where both the equity and
   GDP flags exist** — i.e. through the latest GDP quarter (currently 2026Q1). Any extra
   equity quarter (e.g. 2026Q2) is shown as component-level context only; GDP is never
   imputed/extrapolated to extend `OI`.

## Extensibility / architecture — other Advanced Markets

**Locked architecture:** the engine is `run(country_config, method_config)`.

- `country_config` = { share-price id, GDP id, CPI source, credit id, property id } (+ any
  country-specific data quirks). Canada is the first instance.
- `method_config` is **shared across all AMs**: the AM bands (Step 4), thresholds and
  weights (Step 7–8), and CF `drift=True`.

Applying the engine to another advanced market means swapping only `country_config`; the
shared `method_config` keeps gaps comparable to the paper's thresholds.

## Interpretation / framing (important)

Canada has essentially **no systemic banking crisis** in the Laeven–Valencia database, so:
- thresholds were calibrated on *other* AMs' crises and applied to Canada;
- there is no Canadian crisis to "backtest" against — validation is via sanity checks
  (does the index rise in known booms, e.g. late-1980s, 2000s housing);
- results read as *overheating risk relative to a crisis-calibrated bar*, not a prediction
  that Canada will have a crisis. We report the flags as the paper defines them.

## Open items (F — settle later, do not forget)

- ~~**Output-gap cross-check source:** Bank of Canada vs. IMF WEO~~ — **settled (Phase 3):**
  Bank of Canada quarterly output gap (all three `INDINF_*` measures). See "Output-gap
  cross-check" above.
- **Dashboard deflation details:** confirm real-credit deflation and any dashboard bands.
  Dashboard extras stay directional context only — see
  [decisions/0003](decisions/0003-no-dashboard-thresholds.md).

## Caveats

- A quarter's real-time (one-sided) read can differ from its hindsight (two-sided) read,
  sometimes in sign — but one-sided values themselves never move (Step 5).
- GDP is revised for several quarters after release; a near-threshold reading can wobble
  between refreshes for that reason alone.
- The composite index date is anchored to the latest GDP quarter (currently 2026Q1),
  even though the equity component runs to 2026Q2 (see Engine design decision 2).

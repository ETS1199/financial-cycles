  Turning-point dating algorithm the paper uses to derive its Table 2 cycle-length bands.
  We consume those bands directly and do not run the dating step ourselves.

  The specific BBQ implementation of Harding–Pagan that Chen & Svirydzenka follow for cycle
  dating: run on the log-level, min phase 2 quarters, min complete cycle 5 quarters, with
  the 2-quarter min-phase waived when a one-quarter asset-price decline exceeds 20%. Cited

## Software implementation

- **statsmodels `cffilter` (Christiano–Fitzgerald filter), version 0.14.6.**
  Exact code we run for the band-pass filter (incl. the drift adjustment, which the IMF
  paper does not specify — it is an implementation detail from here / CF 2003).
  - Docs: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.filters.cf_filter.cffilter.html
  - Source (pinned): https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/v0.14.6/statsmodels/tsa/filters/cf_filter.py
- Python stack pinned in `requirements.txt` (numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels).

## Data — series used

`python fetch_data.py --list` prints every configured series for every country (provider,
remote id, output file, description). That registry is the source of truth; the tables below
record only what it cannot: **who actually produces the data** behind an aggregator id, and
the access quirks of each provider.

Data vintage is pinned per country in `data/raw/manifest.json`.

**FRED is an aggregator** — cite the underlying producer:

| FRED id pattern | Underlying producer |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| `SPASTT01*` (share prices) | OECD Main Economic Indicators |
| `NGDPRSAXDC*` (real GDP) | OECD / IMF |
| `*BIS`, `Q**M770A` (credit, property) | Bank for International Settlements |
| `CANCPIALL*` (CPI, cross-check only) | OECD |
| `CPIAUCSL` (US CPI) | US Bureau of Labor Statistics |

**Statistics Canada** — the CPI deflator actually used for Canada:

- CPI, all-items, monthly, 2002=100 — **vector v41690973**, table **18-10-0004-01**.
  - https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000401
  - FRED's Canadian CPI is a rebased copy of this same StatCan data, so we use StatCan
    wholesale rather than splicing. The FRED `cpi_*` series are cached as a cross-check only.

**Bank of Canada** — official quarterly output gap (Phase-3 cross-check of our filtered GDP
gap; validation only), via the Valet API:

| Role | BoC series (Valet code) |
|------|-------------------------|
| Output gap — Current MPR | INDINF_OUTGAPMPR_Q |
| Output gap — Integrated Framework | INDINF_OUTGAPI_Q |
| Output gap — Extended Multivariate Filter | INDINF_OUTGAPM_Q |

## Data providers & access notes

Equity and real GDP come from FRED where available; CPI comes from a **national or current
source**, because FRED's OECD CPI lags a year or more. Adapters live in `fetch_data.py`.

| Provider | Serves | Access notes |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| **FRED API** (`api.stlouisfed.org`) | equity, GDP, some CPI | Must use the API with a free key — **not** the `fredgraph.csv` chart endpoint, which WAF-blocks datacenter IPs. Key in gitignored `.fred_api_key`. Throttles bursts; a throttled request hangs until timeout. |
| **Eurostat** (`prc_hicp_midx`, `namq_10_gdp`) | EU/EEA GDP + CPI | Open, no key. One source covers the whole bloc (incl. Switzerland GDP as EFTA). |
| **ONS** (UK) | UK CPI | Open; `www.ons.gov.uk/…/data`. The old `api.ons.gov.uk` is dead. Current. |
| **ABS** (Australia) | AU CPI | Open SDMX. Use the version-less key so it resolves to the latest dataflow. Current. |
| **StatCan** / **Bank of Canada** | CA CPI / output-gap cross-check | Canada only. |
| **IMF IFS** (via DBnomics) | CPI and GDP for non-EU markets; all three series for Hong Kong | Open, no key; uniform across countries; **lags ~1 year**. Hong Kong equity is `FPE_IX`, a documented proxy for OECD `SPASTT01`. |
